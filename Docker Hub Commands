VRX Docker Image


The repository jordandalessandro/kanaloa_phase2 can create a container that will run the “ros_entrypoint.sh”.
    note: currently no way to stop the command after it has run.
    
In terminal:
docker run --name kanaloa_phase2 jordandalessandro/kanaloa_phase2

In order to edit this container, open a new tab CTRL + SHIFT + T 

In terminal:
docker exec -it kanaloa_phase2 bash

Currently you will need to manually source ros in order to use the ros commands:

In terminal:
source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash

You will be able to see what is running by using the command:

In terminal:
rostopic list
